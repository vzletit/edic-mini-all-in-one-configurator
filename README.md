# EDIC-mini All-in-One Configurator

EDIC-mini All-in-One confugurator is an Android application that allows you to configure modern EDIC-mini voice recorders in a convenient way without misprints.

The application can store settings for different models of voice recorders, as well as different recording conditions (for example, for quiet and noisy rooms, with and without a timer, etc.).

On smartphones with Android up to version 10, ready-made configurations can be downloaded directly into the voice recorder. More recent versions of Android, due to limitations, require transferring the file to the recorder's memory manually (hope there will be a workaround in new versions of voice recorder firmware).

Written in React Native (Expo) using Redux, React Native Elements, etc.

*Version 1 supports only Russian Language yet.*
